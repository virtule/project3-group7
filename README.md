## Project Description
This repository explores CO2 emissions and their impact on global climate change. Here's a quick look at what you'll find:

**Metrics:** We delve into various metrics for comparing CO2 emissions - annual emissions by country, per capita emissions, historical contributions, and trade-adjusted emissions. Each metric tells a different story.
Video: We collaborated with Kurzgesagt to produce a video explaining these metrics in detail: "Who is responsible for climate change? â€“ Who needs to fix it?"
Global Trends: Explore historical trends in global CO2 emissions with interactive charts. See how emissions have risen dramatically since the Industrial Revolution.
Regional Emissions: Discover the breakdown of global CO2 emissions by region. While Europe and the US dominated historically, Asia, particularly China, now leads emissions.
Per Capita Emissions: We analyze per capita CO2 emissions, revealing significant inequalities across countries. Developed nations often have higher emissions per person.
Cumulative Emissions: We examine historical responsibility for climate change by looking at each country's cumulative CO2 emissions since 1751. The US is the largest contributor, followed by the EU and China.
Data Sources: We provide access to the underlying data used in our visualizations, allowing for further exploration.
This is just a part of our extensive work on CO2 emissions. You can also find resources on:

Emissions of other greenhouse gases
Sources of our emissions
Future emission trajectories
Factors driving global emissions
We invite you to explore our collection and gain a deeper understanding of CO2 emissions and their role in climate change.
