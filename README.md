## Project Description
This repository explores CO2 emissions and their impact on global climate change. Here's a quick look at what you'll find:

**Metrics:** We delve into various metrics for comparing CO2 emissions - annual emissions by country, per capita emissions, historical contributions, and trade-adjusted emissions. Each metric tells a different story.

**Global Trends:** Explore historical trends in global CO2 emissions with interactive charts. See how emissions have risen dramatically since the Industrial Revolution.<br>

**Regional Emissions:** Discover the breakdown of global CO2 emissions by region. While Europe and the US dominated historically, Asia, particularly China, now leads emissions.<br>

**Per Capita Emissions:** We analyze per capita CO2 emissions, revealing significant inequalities across countries. Developed nations often have higher emissions per person.<br>

**Cumulative Emissions:** We examine historical responsibility for climate change by looking at each country's cumulative CO2 emissions since 1751. The US is the largest contributor, followed by the EU and China.<br>

**Data Sources:** We provide access to the underlying data used in our visualizations, allowing for further exploration.

**Kaggle:** https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/thedevastator/global-fossil-co2-emissions-by-country-2002-2022 <br>

**Our World In Data:** https://ourworldindata.org/co2-emissions

We invite you to explore our collection and gain a deeper understanding of CO2 emissions and their role in climate change.
